    "1.  What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
    "- Python is a programming language that is popular due to its easy-to-read syntax, large and active community, and a vast collection of libraries and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
    "- In python, interpreter is a program that reads and executes your code line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
    "- Pre-define keywords are special keywords that are built into the language & cannot used as a variable names. It is also called as reserved keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
    "- No, keywors cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
    "- In python, mutability refers to whether or not an object value can be changed after it has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
    "- Why lists are mutable:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Lists are designed to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) You can add, remove, or update items in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) That's helpful when your data needs to change while your program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why tuples are immutable:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Tuples are made to stay the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) They are safer and faster because they can't change.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Useful when you want to protect data from being modified by mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
    "- \"==\" equality operator checks if value are the same, and its doesn't care if the object are stored in the different places.\n",
    "- \"is\" identity operator checks if two variable point to the exact same object in memory, even two values are same its reflect \"False\" due to different object.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
    "- Logical operators used to do logical operations on boolean expressions, it is reflects \"True\" or \"False\" based on there Logic. there are three main logical operator \"and\", \"or\", & \"not\".\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
    "- Type casting means changing the data type of a value from one type to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
    "- Implicit type casting refers automatically changed data type when its needed without any help.\n",
    "- Explicit type casting refers that python cannot changed data type on its own you have to changed it by input commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "- The purpose of conditional statements in python is to control the flow of a program by making decisions based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
    "- The elif (short of else if) statement used when you want to check more than one conditions, and it is used after \"if\" and before \"else\" statement in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
    "- \"for\" loop: Used when you know how many times you want to repeat something.\n",
    "- \"while\" loop:  Used when you dont know how many times the loop should run."
